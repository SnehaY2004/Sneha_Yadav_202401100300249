Sneha Yadav - CSEAI Project (202401100300249)
Overview
This repository contains the project work completed by Sneha Yadav as part of the CSEAI course in the Computer Science and Engineering program. The project involves using machine learning and data analysis techniques to tackle a specific problem, which includes preprocessing data, building models, and evaluating results.

The project is implemented using Python and the Jupyter Notebook environment. It provides a comprehensive analysis, including the data collection, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation phases.

Project Details
Objective:
The main objective of this project is to:

Perform data analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the provided dataset.

Build and evaluate machine learning models to solve the problem (classification, regression, etc.).

Provide a detailed report explaining the methodology, results, and insights drawn from the data.

Technologies Used:
Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries:

Pandas

Numpy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)

TensorFlow / Keras (if deep learning models are used)

Project Steps:
Data Collection:

The dataset was sourced from [provide the source or data description].

The data consists of [mention the data type, e.g., numerical, categorical, text data, etc.].

Data Preprocessing:

Missing values were handled using [methods used, e.g., imputation, removal].

Categorical variables were encoded using [methods like one-hot encoding, label encoding].

Data normalization and scaling were done using [methods like MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler].

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizations were created to understand trends, patterns, and outliers in the data.

Statistical measures were used to identify correlations and relationships between features.

Modeling:

Several machine learning models were explored, including:

Linear Regression / Logistic Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forests

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Neural Networks (if applicable)

Hyperparameter tuning was performed using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to improve model performance.

Evaluation:

Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as:

Accuracy (for classification problems)

Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) (for regression problems)

Confusion Matrix / ROC-AUC for classification tasks.

Results & Conclusion:

The best-performing model was selected based on the evaluation metrics.

Insights derived from the data and recommendations for further improvements or future work
